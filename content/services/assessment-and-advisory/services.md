  - title: 'Penetration Testing (Internal/External)'
    icon: 'penetration-testing'
    text:
      - 'Penetration Testing is the simulation of an attacker’s activities with the goal of testing and validating the security of IT systems. Ideally, a penetration test includes systems or networks thought to be secure.'
      - 'This service helps identify and rate vulnerabilities in the organization’s environment and provides a set of recommendations for improvement.'
      - 'In addition to the inherent benefit of the service, many cybersecurity insurance policies and compliance regimes require regular penetration testing.'

    bulletList:
      - 'External penetration test has become a commodity and check box for some companies, Nexum’s approach is a far more robust and personalized process.'
      - 'Internal penetration tests can be especially beneficial in cases of new acquisitions and to remediate post-breach.'
      - 'Find out what you don’t know.'

  - title: 'Application Testing'
    icon: 'application-testing'
    text:
      - 'An Application Test seeks to locate and document vulnerabilities in applications, including unauthorized data access and privilege escalation issues.'
      - 'Applications we test range from web-based and mobile apps to client/server applications. Many attacks leverage issues created through insecure coding, library use, and logic issues in the applications.'
      - 'Vulnerability Assessments are typically unable to detect these vulnerabilities that require an in-depth test across privilege levels and use cases present in modern applications.'

    bulletList:
      - 'Goes beyond just running a scanner'
      - 'Increased relevance with AI coding'

  - title: 'Wireless Security Testing'
    icon: 'wireless-security'
    text:
      - 'Wireless networks have become the norm in almost every organization. This service evaluates whether proper authentication, encryption, and client-side protections are in use and properly configured.'
      - 'We can also detect and report unauthorized wireless networks that may be present and test resistance to common attacks using rogue or imposter networks.'

    bulletList:
      - 'In depth testing with engineer on-site'

  - title: 'Physical Security Review'
    icon: 'physical-security-review'
    text:
      - 'Engineers examine and test an organization’s physical security controls in a Physical Security Review.'
      - 'Testing ranges from escorted observational review to entering facilities undetected. Common engagements include tailgating attempts, examination of workspaces for unsafe practices, and testing the protections of data centers.'

    bulletList: []

  - title: 'Social Engineering and Phishing'
    icon: 'social-engineering'
    text:
      - 'Humans remain the weakest link in most security incidents. We help your organization test its “human defenses” from technology through personnel and test whether your organization is sufficiently prepared to avoid falling prey to a social engineering attack.'

    bulletList:
      - 'Can be combined with external pen test'
      - 'Can be completely customized and/or scenario based'
      - 'Goes beyond basic attacks and can help detect risk from more sophisticated approaches'

  - title: 'Red Team/Blue Team Exercise'
    icon: 'cyberattack'
    text:
      - 'Many organizations are less prepared to respond to an actual attack than they might like. We help test your incident response plans and response team readiness by emulating real-world scenarios.'
      - 'Our skilled testing team provides guidance to ensure that when an incident does occur, your organization is prepared and practiced in the proper response protocols.'

    bulletList:
      - 'Valuable part of a comprehensive incident response plan'
      - 'In depth, heavy weight reporting vs. conventional scanner reports'
      - 'Fully customizable and offers testing in “live” experience'

  - title: 'Controls Testing'
    icon: 'controls-testing'
    text:
      - 'A Controls Test is scenario-based penetration testing, where Nexum engineers focus on speciﬁc security controls.'
      - 'Scoping for a Controls Test engagement is flexible to afford an opportunity for the in-depth investigation of speciﬁc technologies and processes.'

    bulletList:
      - 'Narrow focused penetration test to determine any weaknesses from new vendors, methods, vulnerabilities/threats, etc.'

  - title: 'Organizational (Framework) Assessment'
    icon: 'infrastructure'
    text:
      - 'For any organization wishing to align with an established cybersecurity framework (for example, the NIST CSF), we perform an evaluation of your current security posture and collaboratively build a plan toward alignment with the framework.'
      - 'We have helped clients improve compliance across a wide variety of security frameworks and models.'

    bulletList:
      - 'Nexum acts as your advisor to meet framework requirements'
      - 'Process can include interviews, process observation, technical probing, & gap investigation'

  - title: 'Systems Architecture and Infrastructure Assessment'
    icon: 'systems-architecture'
    text:
      - 'Nexum engineers don’t just critique system security; they also design and build for it.'
      - 'In a Systems Architecture engagement, Nexum engineers review objectives with client personnel in formal and informal sessions, document technical and business design objectives, then create a draft design including key systems elements.'
      - 'Architecture projects have ranged from warehouse wireless design to global enterprise security architectures with multiyear roadmaps.'

    bulletList:
      - 'Expert review supported and accelerated by tool use (“by hand” in addition to tool-driven)'
      - 'Customizable and/or set by regulations and standards'
      - 'Can be just key devices or limited to “rules” vs. wide range of products throughout an enterprise and across a wide variety of systems'
      - 'Are “best practices” still being followed over time and changes to environment'

  - title: 'Systems Security Assessment'
    icon: 'systems-security'
    text:
      - 'We perform a detailed examination of an organization’s key security system configurations to determine its security posture, ﬁnd and document vulnerabilities, and produce recommendations to enhance security.'
      - 'This review can include both external and internal systems and review against common security frameworks as well as industry best practices.'
      - 'This service will help ensure that your systems are configured with security in mind and help identify weaknesses in your overall security posture or architecture.'
