Nexum, Inc. is a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business
(SDVOSB), verified by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). To
qualify as an SDVOSB, a business must be owned or controlled by a
Service-Disabled Veteran. We take great pride in this designation,
contribute to veteran organizations, and support our current veteran
team members. In fact, 11% of Nexum employees are veterans or first
responders.
