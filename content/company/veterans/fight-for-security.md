Does military experience translate well into the world of
cybersecurity? Hodge thinks so.

“You have a goal and you charge after it. Things happen quickly so
it’s imperative that you tackle the project immediately in front of

information technology industry, “you have to use your team members’
skillsets wisely, and the hard work and creative problem-solving will
pay off in the end.”
