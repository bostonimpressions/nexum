The year 2022 marks a massive milestone for Nexum. Founded in April
2002, we are proud to celebrate our 20th anniversary.

“I started Nexum 20 years ago with two employees and the bold idea to
do what’s right for the customer and let success follow,” says David
J. Lesser, Founder and CEO of Nexum. “That remains our vision to this
day. Nexum has grown to nearly 100 employees and made a name for
itself in the industry.
